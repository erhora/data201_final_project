# data201_final_project
Group Members: Zhiyan (Hermione) Deng, Elizabeth Hora, Vanessa Venkataraman

This is our group submission for the DATA-201 course in the Tufts University Data Analytics Master's Program. We sought to understand more about the differences between stars in different stages of their life cycles. Our models (K Nearest Neighbors, Logistic Regression, Support Vector Machine, and Random Forest) attempted to differentiate between Young Stellar Objects (YSOs), Main Sequence (MS) stars, and Asymptotic Giant Branch (ABG) stars.

## Presentation
This file has the slides of what we would have presented ([Google Slides Link](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1kbiXffF7JRfjDWZOD-mu5ak9PhO5y0o-B3VkwDmuLHM/edit?usp=sharing)).

## dividing_truth_set
This file splits up our large dataset that is too large to post to GitHub into smaller chunks that are in compliance with the 25 MB limit.

## assembling_the_truth
This file takes the files as a result of the split and assembles them into the same truth set we could use on our local machines.

## final_notebook
This is the final draft of our Jupyter Notebook used to generate the models described in the presentation.
