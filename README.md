## Presentation
This file has the slides of what we would have presented.

## dividing_truth_set
This file splits up our large dataset that is too large to post to GitHub into smaller chunks that are in compliance with the 25 MB limit.

## assembling_the_truth
This file takes the files as a result of the split and assembles them into the same truth set we could use on our local machines.

## final_notebook
This is the final draft of our Jupyter Notebook used to generate the models described in the presentation.
